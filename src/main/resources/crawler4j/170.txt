The PayPal Cash Card is not a credit card. PayPal is not a bank and does not itself take deposits. You will not receive any interest on the funds in your PayPal Cash Plus account. Funds you hold in a PayPal Cash Plus account are not insured by the FDIC unless you have successfully requested a PayPal Cash Card. If you have successfully requested a PayPal Cash Card, then we will deposit the funds in your PayPal Cash Plus account into a pooled deposit account held by us for your benefit at an FDIC-insured bank. This structure used for accounts with a PayPal Cash Card is intended to provide the funds in your PayPal Cash Plus account with the benefit of pass-through FDIC insurance up to applicable limits. The PayPal Cash Mastercard is issued by The Bancorp Bank pursuant to a license by Mastercard International Incorporated. Mastercard is a registered trademark and the circles design is a trademark of Mastercard International Incorporated. The Bancorp Bank is issuer of the Card only and not responsible for the associated accounts or other products, services or offers from PayPal. Card may be used everywhere Mastercard is accepted. The Bancorp Bank does not hold your PayPal Cash Plus funds. 2A PayPal Cash Plus account is required to get the card. Approval contingent on ID verification. IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW CARD ACCOUNT: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens a Card Account. What this means for you: When you open a Card Account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see a copy of your driver’s license or other identifying documents. Terms apply. See Cardholder Agreement for details. 3Direct Deposit is subject to the payor's support of this feature.
