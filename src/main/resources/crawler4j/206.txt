During onboarding, PayPal automates Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, so we vet your sellers, run identity checks, and conduct compliance checks (Office of Foreign Asset Control and Anti-Money Laundering) for you. How it works To onboard, your seller clicks a sign-up link on your website which redirects them to PayPal to log in to or sign up for a PayPal account and to grant you permissions to process payments on their behalf. You use the Partner Referrals API to prefill the onboarding form with data that you have previously collected about your sellers, and you can localize the form fields. Onboard your sellers Choosing when you will onboard your sellers determines which integration instructions you need: Onboard before sellers receive payment Onboard after sellers receive payment Build seller onboarding into your ecommerce software package Developer Docs Catalog APIs Engineering Blog About Us Support FAQ Help Center Technical Support Community Contact Sales Tools PayPal Demo API Executor API Status Sandbox GitHub Partner Directory PSD2 Compliance Family PayPal Braintree Hyperwallet Simility Privacy Legal Contact © 2020 PayPal ╳ ╳ Popular Search Queries sandbox client id and secret IPN (Instant Payment Notifications) refund payments buttons PayPal Help FAQ's Tech Support Community PayPal Community Test Credit Card numbers for use on PayPal sandbox Merchant Security Upgrade Testing Inserting company logo in payment page Checkout as Guest Option Turned on, but option not available to customers Create specific paypal button for 3 types of payment options Load More Clear All
