Level 1 PCI compliant Braintree is a validated Level 1 PCI DSS compliant service provider. Industry recognition We're on Visa's Global Compliant Provider and Mastercard's SDP List No prohibited data storage We don't store raw magnetic stripe, card validation code, or PIN block data. Data encryption via the Braintree Vault Cardholder data is managed in the Braintree Vault, using multiple encryption keys with split knowledge and dual control. A data thief would not be able to make use of information stolen from a database without also having the key. This data store cannot be connected to via the internet. We also offer secure data data migration to the Braintree Vault. Authentication and session management We require users to authenticate every time they log into the Control Panel. Passwords are never stored directly in the database, and all API and Control Panel communication between merchants and Braintree is conducted using TLS (Transport Layer Security). Activity monitoring and testing We review and observe employee, customer, and vendor activity to guard against suspicious or unauthorized activities. We conduct automated vulnerability scans at least quarterly, and at least once a year we have extended penetration testing conducted by outside sources. Report a security issue and we will respond within 24 hours. Any other questions? Contact us.
